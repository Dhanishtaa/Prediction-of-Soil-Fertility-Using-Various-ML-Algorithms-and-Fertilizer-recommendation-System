This project is about "Prediction of Soil Fertility Using Various Machine Learning Algorithms and Fertilizer Recommendation System".We collected the data set from the Kaggle which contains the values of N, P, K nutrient content in the soil.
Among various classification algorithms like Random Forest, SVM, Decision tree, KNN etc, Random Forest shows the highest occuracy.
I also recommended Fertilizer for the soil based on the N, P, K values through web application using Flask.
